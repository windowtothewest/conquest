    "event_description": "In the peculiar nation of [Nation Name], a scandalous revelation has surfaced concerning public sector employees' salaries. It has come to light that a long-forgotten law mandates that all public sector salaries be paid in the form of onions instead of traditional currency. This archaic regulation, buried in the depths of bureaucratic archives, resurfaced when a mischievous intern stumbled upon it while organizing old government documents. As news of this bizarre law spreads, public sector workers are in an uproar, debating the practicality and absurdity of receiving their wages in onions. Some are delighted by the prospect of free groceries, while others are appalled by the inconvenience and stench it brings to their lives.",

This will revolutionize our economy and promote healthy eating!",
