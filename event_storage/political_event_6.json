    "event_description": "In the interstellar realm of [Nation Name], an unexpected conflict has arisen with a neighboring alien civilization over the ownership of a seemingly ordinary asteroid that is suspected to contain a rare mineral coveted by both sides. The asteroid, known colloquially as 'Rocky McRockface,' sits on the border between the two territories and has suddenly become the focal point of a heated war of words and diplomatic standoffs. While some politicians advocate for a peaceful resolution through negotiation and sharing of resources, others demand a military show of force to assert dominance in the region. The citizens of [Nation Name] are divided, with some embracing the idea of alien friends and intergalactic trade, while others fear the unknown and cling to the comfort of terrestrial isolationism.",
