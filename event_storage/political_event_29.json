    "event_description": "In the whimsical nation of [Nation Name], a peculiar controversy has arisen concerning the attire worn by the local wildlife. A group of avant-garde fashion designers claim that the native animals lack style and sophistication in their natural fur and feather coats. To address this 'fashion emergency,' they propose a bill that mandates all animals to undergo a mandatory fashion makeover, complete with custom-designed outfits that reflect their personality and habitat. As the proposal sparks heated discussions across the nation, wildlife enthusiasts argue over the ethical implications of dressing up animals and the potential impact on their behavior and natural interactions.",
