    "event_description": "In the vibrant nation of [Nation Name], a peculiar mandate from the Ministry of Culture has emerged - the Anthem Amplification Act. This law stipulates that all national anthems played or sung in public spaces must be performed at a volume of at least 120 decibels. The rationale behind this ruling, as explained by the Minister of Culture in a press conference, is to 'bolster national pride through auditory stimulation and ensure that the anthem reverberates through every citizen's core.' Citizens are now divided between those who see this as a unique way to showcase patriotism and those who are concerned about potential hearing damage and noise complaints.",
