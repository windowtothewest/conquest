    "event_description": "In the eco-conscious nation of [Nation Name], a heated debate has ignited over the government's proposed plan to combat climate change by implementing a mandatory 'Go Green or Go Home' policy. This policy requires all households to reduce their carbon footprint by 50% within the next year, or face relocation to specially designated 'Eco-Cities' where sustainable living practices are strictly enforced. Environmental activists praise the bold move as a necessary step towards a greener future, while skeptics argue that it infringes on personal freedom and will lead to chaos and mass protests in the streets.",
