    "event_title": "The Trash Talk Tragedy",
    "event_description": "In the bustling metropolis of [Nation Name], a scandalous incident has unfolded, leading to a city-wide debate on waste management practices. It all started when a local neighborhood association accused the municipal waste collection agency of eavesdropping on citizens through specialized trash bins equipped with listening devices. The agency defended its actions, claiming it was a necessary step to monitor waste disposal habits and educate the public on recycling. The public is outraged, with some demanding immediate removal of the 'spying bins,' while others argue for their importance in promoting eco-friendly behaviors. The city is divided, with tensions rising as more details about the extent of surveillance emerge, leaving [Nation Name] in a state of trash-fueled turmoil.",
