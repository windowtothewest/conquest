    "event_description": "In the jubilant nation of [Nation Name], an extravagant public celebration known as the Costume Carnival is held annually to honor the quirky tradition of dressing up in outlandish costumes and masks. This year, however, the event planners have decided to add a controversial twist to the festivities.

The nation is abuzz with excitement and confusion as citizens debate the implications of this new requirement on their beloved Carnival.",
