# Project Summary

This project aims to provide the experience of being the leader of a nation and enjoying the feedback loop of the effects of your choices on your country. 

## Features Implemented

- Nation creation.
- Political alignment, change of Overton Window label as a result of your responses to events. 
- Ability to respond to 60 unique events that affect the political leanings of your country. 

## Running the game
This is just a command line game at the moment, later on I'd like to make it playable through a web browser. Give it a shot by cloning the repo and running 
```python src/pipeline.py``` with Python version >= 3.10. 

## Current Progress

The project is currently in its early stages of development. The basic infrastructure and core functionalities have been implemented. The next steps involve refining the gameplay mechanics, adding more features, and improving the user interface.

- Add the ability to control the taxation rate, and implement the effects of taxation on consumption and economic growth. 
- Add economic growth forecasting to see how your choices are affecting (or hurting) the development of your nation. 
- View your population pyramid be altered as a result of your policy choices. 
- Add the ability to go on military conquests once your population has grown enough. 
- Integrate multiplayer functionality including trade policy, alliances and warfare.
